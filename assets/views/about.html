				Hello and welcome to my website!
			</p>
			<p>
				My name is Son. At the moment, I'm a student but I will graduate from Lahti University of Applied Sciences in the end of May.
				My major is Business Information Technology which is a hybrid degree program of Business and IT, as its name implies. However,
				I focus more on IT and spend most of my studies time working on it.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am a supporter of the open-source movement and a member of VietLug - Vietnamese Linux Users' Group. 
				By following open-source project, I can learn new things and improve my skills as well as share knowledge with other people.
