### Kanban board web application for Lahti University of Applied Sciences (LAMK)</h3>
This web application development is a visual management tool which was developed as OSS and dedicated to LAMK. It can be used to control the flow of teamwork.
With the help of this tool, team is able to see who is working for which task, thus enable better visual communication over team’s overall work in a time box.
Further the tool would be enabling better visibility to see how the work is progressing over time and illustrating received business value that is created in a project.</p></br>

**Value of the application:** LAMK project teams can utilize agile methodology with lean approach. Electronic Kanban board
would bring visibility to not only current work and team level but also to individual level: who is doing
what and how much “points” have been earned within a sprint. Team leaders or “scrum masters”
could see directly how efficiently the team is working and where to find the obstacles or barriers for
working. The board also works as basis for every day standup meeting content (Show-and-tell)
