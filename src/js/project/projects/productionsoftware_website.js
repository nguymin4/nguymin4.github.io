This project is a part of the course Content Managment System at my school. 
I designed custom theme and then coded and deployed it in August 2014.

It's powered by **Wordpress**. The customer is quite satisfied with it that's why it's mostly the same as I designed it nearly two years ago.
You can visit the website at http://productionsoftware.fi

However, the website's biggest drawback is that it's not responsive.
