Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. 
Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. 
The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context. (https://projecteuler.net/)

I solved the problems with **Python** as programming language.
